This folder contains the files that I have built to setup several TI simulations.

EQModify ---> Adds the non-bonded parameters and mass of atom type X to the system with parameters equal to Ca2+ for lambda = 0 and Mg2+ for lambda = 1.

TI-Foldermaker.sh ---> Creats folders for TI steps.

TI.in ---> LAMMPS input script which randomly changes y% of atoms of type Ca2+ to type X and runs a simulation.
